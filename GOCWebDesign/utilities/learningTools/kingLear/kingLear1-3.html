			  {speaker: "Edmund", text: "Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law My services are bound. Wherefore should I stand in the plague of custom, and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me, ...Why bastard? wherefore base?"},
			  {speaker: "Gloucester", text: "These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide the bond crack'd twixt father and son"},
			  {speaker: "Edmund", text: "A credulous father! and a brother noble, Whose nature is so far from doing harms, That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty My practises ride easy!"},

			  {speaker: "Lear", text: "Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!"},

			  {speaker: "Lear", text: "O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;"},
			  {speaker: "Lear", text: "Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,"},
			  {speaker: "Lear", text: "O! I have ta'en Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,"},
			  {speaker: "Lear", text: "unaccomodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art"},
			  {speaker: "The Fool", text: "He's mad, that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath"},
